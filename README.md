This is a 3D web application made by Three.js that simulates planetary system and natural or unnatural landscapes on planets. You will drive an ufo to explore in the Solar system. During the exploration, you may fall into the secret scenes on some of the planets, such as Earth, Saturn and Jupiter. All the scenes are elaborated to provide you a nice exploring experience.

## Instructions

Press WASD to move, press shift to speed up. Click a place to transfer. Press the Escape to open the menus.

Earth, Saturn and Jupiter are three magic planets. Find these three planets and click them to chase them. After 5 seconds, you will be redirected to the island, stormy word and alien base, respectively.

If you want to go back to the solar, just fly to the sky and then you will be redirected to the solar (click the moon in the island or click the Jupiter in the alien base is also okay).
