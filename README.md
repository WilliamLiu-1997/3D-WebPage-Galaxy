# Solar Human Alien

The solar.html is a 3D webpage made by three.js which simulates the planetary system. A UFO can be controlled to explore the secrets in it.

Press WASD to move, press shift to speed up. Click a place to transfer. Press the Escape to open the menus.

Earth, Saturn and Jupiter are three magic planets. Find these three planets and click them to chase them. After 5 seconds, you will be redirected to the island, stormy word and alien base, respectively.

In island and alien base, you can also click somewhere to move. If you want to go back to the solar, just fly high enough and then you will be redirected to the solar (click the moon in the island or click the Jupiter in the alien base is also okay).

A RTX2060 or better GPU is highly recommended for this program!
